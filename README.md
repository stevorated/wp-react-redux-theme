# A React+Redux WordPress theme
WordPress theme built with react calling WP-API for content.

## Current Features
If you install it in WordPress v4.7 or greater **it will work out of the box** and have many of the features you'd want in a simple blog.

(Almost) out of the box, note: you need to enable pretty permalinks...

**Existing features include:**
- Dynamic menus (main menu + footer menu)
- "Template pages" equivalence for [index.php, single.php, search.php, category.php]... but in React/Redux
- Search
- Category archive pages
- First level sub-categories
- Tags
- Bootstrap 4
- Threaded comments
- Dynamic Head title tag
